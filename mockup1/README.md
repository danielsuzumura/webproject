# First milestone

## Requirements
  * The system must have 2 types of users: Clients and Administrators
      * Administrators are responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The   application already comes with an account admin with       password admin.
      * Customers are users who access the system to buy products/services.
  * The admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email.
  * Each customer's record includes, at least: name, id, address, phone, email
  * Product/services records include, at least: name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock), quantity sold.
  * Your store may sell products, services or both (you decide)
  * Selling Products (or services): Products are selected, their quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Products are purchased using a credit card number (any number is accepted by the system). The quantity of product sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.
  * Product/Service Management: Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.
  * Your functionality: Create a functionality that is specific to your application. It does not have to be something complicated. For instance, if you are selling cars, you may allow users to use an accelerator to hear how each car engine roars up and down.   
  * The system must provide accessibility requirements and provide good usability. The system must be responsive.
  * The customer should be able to search for individual items using a search bar.
  * The customer should be able to write reviews of the products.

## Project Description
  * The project consists of a website for an online grocery store.
  * The navigation diagram below helps to how navigate in the website and will work until the final release:

  * For the mockup, we have this navigation diagram:

  * At the end, the website will be launched as a Single-Page Aplication Style, using templates for visualization in the main page:

  * Mockups made with HTML5 and CSS3: https://danielsuzumura.github.io/webproject/
  * Mockups made in FIGMA for the remaining major screen:   
    * Admin page:

  * For our specific functionality, we'll allow customers to select individual items of products like fruits, whose quality of each individual item is important. It'll be done by showing the picture of the available items and allowing to select them when the customer chooses to add any amount of the product to the cart.

## Comments About the Code
* At the time of the Milestone 1, only the product apple was implemented (can be accessed in PRODUCT -> Fruits). The css and html used in the apple page will mostly be reused in the pages of the other products.
## Test Plan

## Test Results
* The tests made by the group was described in the folder called "test"
## Build Procedures
* Using a browser and having internet connection, open the website https://github.com/danielsuzumura/webproject
* From the top of the page, in the bottom-right corner of the page, click in "github-pages", below the Environments topic.
* Find the most recent release of the site and click "View deployment"
* Finally, enjoy the website
## Problems
   * In the product site, the formatting of the three boxes in the entry of the page has been complicated to ajust, since the float in css was not covered in his plenitude at the time of the Milestone 1 deadline.   
   * The design of the pages and the good practices of web coding were themes that we, at the time of Milestone 1, do not mastered. Therefore, we must improve these topics in the future.
