## Requirements
  * The system must have 2 types of users: Clients and Administrators
      * Administrators are responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The   application already comes with an account admin with       password admin.
      * Customers are users who access the system to buy products/services.
  * The admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email.
  * Each customer's record includes, at least: name, id, address, phone, email
  * Product/services records include, at least: name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock), quantity sold.
  * Your store may sell products, services or both (you decide)
  * Selling Products (or services): Products are selected, their quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Products are purchased using a credit card number (any number is accepted by the system). The quantity of product sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.
  * Product/Service Management: Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.
  * Your functionality: Create a functionality that is specific to your application. It does not have to be something complicated. For instance, if you are selling cars, you may allow users to use an accelerator to hear how each car engine roars up and down.   
  * The system must provide accessibility requirements and provide good usability. The system must be responsive.
  * The customer should be able to search for individual items using a search bar.
  * The customer should be able to write reviews of the products.

## Project Description
  * The project consists of a website for an online grocery store.
  * It's made using single-page application (SPA) style, rewriting the current page dynamically according to the user interactions.
  * We are using the Vue framework.
  * For our specific functionality, we implemented a review functionality, where the customer can give a rating and an opinion about the product.

## Comments About the Code
* To access the administrator page inside the application, simply click in "Login" and type "admin@admin" and "admin" in the username and password respective fields.<br>
Then, click on the button called "ADMIN" that would appear on the topper bar.

## Test Plan
Tests will be made manually by trying to reproduce each funcionality and the results will be documented in one markdown file for each area of the website.
## Test Results
* The tests made by the group were described in the folder called "test" along with each test result.
## Build Procedures

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# compile vue
npm run build

# run server
npm start
```
## Problems
* Funcionalities not working due to lack of server-side:
  * Admin: Adding a product(doesn't accept image input)
  * Information lost when page is reloaded: Admin permission if added, product created or edited.
